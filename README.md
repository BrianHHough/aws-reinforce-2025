# COM322: Why vibe coding isn’t enough: Building secure AI apps that scale

Vibe coding with GenAI is almost too easy... until your app goes live. Then come unauthenticated access alerts, surprise bills, DDoS attacks, Denial of Wallet events—or worse, a system take down. I’ve built AI-powered systems for millions of users, and I’ve seen how fast becomes fragile without security by design. In this talk, I’ll share what GenAI skips - and how to harden your stack by shifting security left with protective app layers, authentication patterns, Infrastructure as Code, and automated CI/CD deployments to go from vibes to resilient architecture. If you're building with AI, this talk might save your app - and your business.
